#coding:utf-8We introduced Recursive Neural Tensor Networks
and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank. The combination
of new model and data results in a system
for single sentence sentiment detection that pushes
state of the art by 5.4% for positive/negative sentence
classification. Apart from this standard setting,
the dataset also poses important new challenges
and allows for new evaluation metrics. For instance,
the RNTN obtains 80.7% accuracy on fine-grained
sentiment prediction across all phrases and captures
negation of different sentiments and scope more accurately
than previous models.
